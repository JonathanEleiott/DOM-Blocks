# WIIFM

Web developers need to write programs which respond to user interactions with forms, and form elements.

# Overview

The data, which determines the user interface, will change based on the selections of the user.

# Slide Deck should include
- The data to UI paradigm
- Adding Event Handlers -> functions for user interaction
- Event handler functions -> are called, we don't call them
- Example, click of a button, submission of a form
- Forms -> interactive interfaces
- Forms -> composed of buttons, drop downs, inputs etc
- For interactive applications -> bypass normal form behavior -> ev.preventDefault()
- User Event -> ie form submission -> data change -> render
- Event Handlers - passed events -> can be used to find target 
- Target -> can be used to traverse DOM

# Utilizes

- forms
  - select
  - input
  - button
- document.addEventListener
- preventDefault() 
- DOM traversal
  - parentNode
  - children
  - spread
- Array.splice
- Array.filter
